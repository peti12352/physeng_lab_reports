\section{M1: Investigation of a Common-Emitter Amplifier}

\subsection{DC Operating Point}
The DC voltages of the amplifier were measured at the transistor's electrodes with the input left open.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U_B = \SI{1.263}{V}$
    \item $U_C = \SI{7.42}{V}$
    \item $U_E = \SI{0.619}{V}$
\end{itemize}
From these, the base-emitter and collector-emitter voltages were calculated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U_{BE} = U_B - U_E = \SI{0.644}{V}$
    \item $U_{CE} = U_C - U_E = \SI{6.801}{V}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Saturation Measurement}
A \SI{1}{kHz} sinusoidal input signal was applied. The input amplitude was increased until the output signal began to show distortion. Saturation was observed to begin at an input amplitude of \SI{208}{mV}.

\subsection{Frequency Response}
The frequency response of the amplifier was measured by applying a sinusoidal input of constant amplitude and varying the frequency. The input and output voltages were recorded at several frequencies.

\subsection{Cut-off Frequencies and Bandwidth}
The lower and upper cut-off frequencies were determined to be $f_l = \SI{57}{Hz}$ and $f_u = \SI{82.3}{kHz}$. The bandwidth of the amplifier is $B = f_u - f_l = \SI{82.24}{kHz}$.

\subsection{Miller Effect}
A \SI{22}{pF} capacitor was connected between the collector and base of the transistor. This reduced the upper cut-off frequency to $f_u = \SI{12}{kHz}$.

\subsection{Cascade Circuit}
The circuit was modified into a cascade configuration. This increased the upper cut-off frequency significantly to $f_u = \SI{271}{kHz}$.

\section{M2: Investigation of a Common-Collector Amplifier}

\subsection{Gain and Phase Shift}
At \SI{1}{kHz}, with an input of $U_{in} = \SI{1010}{mV}$, the output was $U_{out} = \SI{920}{mV}$. This gives a voltage gain of $A_u = 0.91$. The phase shift was $\phi = \SI{0.2}{\degree}$.

\subsection{Frequency Response}
The frequency response was investigated at several input frequencies.

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Input Resistance}
The input resistance of the common-collector amplifier was measured to be $R_{in} = \SI{37}{k\ohm}$.

\subsection{High Input Resistance Configuration}
The circuit was modified to a high input resistance configuration. The input resistance was measured to be $R_{in} = \SI{151}{k\ohm}$.

\section{Conclusion}
The characteristics of a common-emitter amplifier were measured. The operating point, gain, and bandwidth were determined. The measurements confirm the expected behavior, including the \SI{180}{\degree} phase inversion and the frequency limitations of the amplifier. The Miller effect and the cascade configuration demonstrated methods to influence the high-frequency performance.

The common-collector amplifier was also investigated, confirming its characteristics such as voltage gain close to unity, no phase inversion, and high input impedance.

% GGG
We did not properly save the table data during our measurement excercise and we lost it. Czehl√°r Gergely and Hunyady Csongor were kind enough to share this data with us. The raw data in Tables 1 and 2 \ref{\ref{tab:freq_response_m1}} and \ref{\ref{tab:freq_response_m2}} is theirs.
