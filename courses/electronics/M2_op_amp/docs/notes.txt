## Exercises:

--> using UA741CN

### M1: Inverting amp gain
circuit assembled, excel table: U_in = linspace(init=100 mV, step=100mV) , U_out

Slope: −4.7257 => gain = 4.7257 (fit param from first 6 datapoints before saturated)
Intercept: 36.2571

it clearly shows a linear region up to around 600 mV input, 
followed by output saturation around U_sat = −3130 mV

### M2: Adder

frist it saturated but the R_v = 470 kOhm was too large we swapped it to R_v = 1 kOhm

R_1 = R_2 = R_s = R_v = 1 kOhm

R_s touched with R_1,2,3 and this made it outout with wrong positive sign

resistor was dead

### M3: Follower

we are using averaging with N=16, at low f there is no phase diff, 
but at high it increases (at 1.1 MOhm its about 180 deg phase diff)

--> using new op amp TL071CP 8839BR

### M4: Differentiator
lot of photos

C1 = 10nF, C2 = 100pF


sine wave: output is 90 deg phase shift (inverted cosine wave, shifted by 90 deg)
triangle: output is square wave 

purpose of C_p: less noisy (high freq noise is cutoff - low pass like regulation),
higher f -> lower Z_C (capacitor impedance) -> lower G (gain)

with C: more stable, less noisy

### M5: Integrator


sine - negative cosine
square - triangle
triangle - perdiodic parabolas

purpose of R_p:

with C: stable (no saturation)
