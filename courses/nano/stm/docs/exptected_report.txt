1. Show the effect of the z_limit to the horizontal resolution of the
STM (you can approximate it with the smallest steps on a small linescan,
resolution = z_limit / 2^16). Compare this using two images with
different z_limit. This will tell you the capabilities of the
piezoscanner.

2. Measure heights of atomic steps on graphite and calculate how many
layers they consist of.

3. Measure the lattice constant on the atomic scale image (after Fourier
filtering) and calculate the distance between atoms in the lattice with
a simple geometric calculation. It will be a little bit different in the
3 equivalent direction due to the thermal drift, check it out. We
expected hexagonal structure but we see triangular one because we only
see every second atoms. The density of states becomes quite different if
there is an atom directly below in the underlying layer or not. I send
the filtered version of one of your measurements.

4. image containing twisted graphene layers. Determine the angle of
rotation between the two layers from the moiré pattern observed on the
graphene. You can use the theoretic lattice constant of graphene (d ~
0.246 nm). Check it out how cool is it that you can see the atomic
resolution and the moiré superstructure in the same image.
