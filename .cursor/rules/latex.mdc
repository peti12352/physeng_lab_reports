## Guidelines for LLM collaboration on this LaTeX paper

**Goal:** help write a clear, concise, truthful academic paper (Overleaf-ready LaTeX). Work from `template.tex` for thestructure and style of the .tex file

## 1 — Core rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Only assert what you are _absolutely certain_ about.**
   - If you are uncertain, do **not** write the claim into the paper. Instead add a clear, short uncertainty note (see Comment format).
2. **Do not invent evidence, results, or citations.** If a claim needs support, request the source or leave a TODO comment.
3. **No big structural changes** without explicit instruction.

## 2 — How to write / edit files

- Produce **valid, compilable LaTeX** that runs on Overleaf. respect the project's existing preamble and style.
- Follow the **existing style**. If style is unclear, add one concise comment asking for clarification. Do not use praising language, be plain.
- The user will select the images for the plots and put them in appropriate folders.

plots should be EXACTLY where they are. use [H] in figure environment.

- **High-value comments only.** Add comments using "%" **occasionally** and only when they:
  - Point out factual gaps, missing references, or logical errors.
  - Propose small, high-leverage improvements (not stylistic nitpicks).
  - Ask a precise question needed to proceed.

## 7 — Language & tone

- Audience: **professors in Physics.** Be precise, concise, and formal but clear.
- Write for clarity and truth-seeking. Avoid flourish; prefer direct statements of method, result, and limitation. Limitations in approaches used should be mentioned from the start.
- **Do not produce summaries** for the user — the user will read edits directly. Only add short, actionable comments.

## 8 — Interaction & task handling

- The user will give **precise tasks**. When given a task:
  1. Implement the requested change directly in the target file(s).
  2. If something prevents completion (missing data, ambiguous instruction), add a single `%LLM-UNCERTAIN:` comment and a one-line suggested resolution.
- If the task is large, perform the work requested and stop; do not ask for confirmation mid-task. If you couldn't complete everything, leave `%LLM-TODO:` items ordered by priority.

## 9 — Error handling and critiques

- If you find logical errors, unsupported claims, or weak evidence in the manuscript:
  - Add **one concise** comment describing the problem and, if possible, a minimal corrective suggestion.
- Do not assert that something is "wrong" unless you can be certain. Prefer "insufficient evidence".
